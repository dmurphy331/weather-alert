# Approach

City list JSON downloaded from openweather API.
Tried inporting JSON locally but decided to move data to mongoDB and get using API vie expressJS for performance/scalabilty.

> **TODO:**
> - Add current weather info to favourite tile.
> - Convert tile to link through to detail view.
> - Create Interface for current and forecasted weather within detail view.
> - Add API call for hourly forecast https://openweathermap.org/api/hourly-forecast
> - Styling, responsive styling.
> - Unit tests.

## Project Quick Start

After installing the requirements above, in the project directory run `yarn && yarn start`. This will:

- Install node dependancies for the client and the server
- Download and start docker container for mongoDB (accessible on `localhost:27017` - details in `server/package.json`)
- Run PM2 in watch mode to start and live-refresh an express server (accessable at `http://localhost:8080/`)
- Start and live-refresh a react app on the client (accessable at `http://localhost:3000/`)

The client and server will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
